Hi there, 
I'm Dominic Emeka

This is one of my simple projects that i build while teaching a beginner web 
development bootcamp at NORAK TECH, during my Industral Training period.

Teaching beginners how to code and build a web site is kind of my thing, 
and the best way i know that is helpful or i found really helpful is by building or crafting 
out what you have imagined, and while taking my coding classes i let my student 
understand that there is more in coding and building websites in visualizing and craftig/designing the images 
in your imagination in other to clearly understand how that project could be built while or before coding or building it.
